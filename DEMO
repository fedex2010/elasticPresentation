/*AYUDA*/
PORQUE ES FACIL DE ESCALAR

One server can hold one or more parts of one or more indexes, and whenever new nodes are introduced to the cluster they are just
being added to the party. Every such index, or part of it, is called a shard, and ElasticSearch shards can be moved around the cluster
very easily.
